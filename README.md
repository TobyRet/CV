My Background
-------------
I've been involved in managing digital products for the last seven years. As Head of Communications at Youth Music I have overseen the design and build of fundraising platforms and online communities. In the last three years, my interest in the technical side of software development grew and my 'part-time programming hobby' lead me to joining Makers Academy - a highly selective, 12 week full-time programme that teaches software development in London. If you are looking for a junior developer that can do more than just code, then look no further!
