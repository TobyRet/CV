My Background
-------------

I've been involved in managing digital products for the past seven years. As Head of Communications at Youth Music I have had the opportunity to work closely with music industry organisations and artists to generate income and raise the profile of the charity. I'm a music lover, and have been gigging with bands since my early teens. I've toured as far afield as the Europe and more recently, have been featured on the backing tracks of 2 playstation games.

Over the past three years, my interest in software development grew until I realised I wanted to play a more *meaningful* role in crafting awesome online experiences. In 2014 I was accepted onto [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a highly selective, 12 week full-time programme that teaches software development in London. 

I will graduate on May 9th 2014.
